/* vaporware/src/display.c — GC9107 LCD driver for N32G031 vape hardware
 *
 * Pin assignments come from config.h (LCD_CS_PORT/PIN, LCD_DC_*, etc.).
 * Default pinout (GV2024 boards):
 *   PB3 = SPI1_SCK   PB5 = SPI1_MOSI   PA15 = CS (software, active-low)
 *   PB7 = D/C (LOW=cmd, HIGH=data)      PB6  = RST (active-low pulse)
 *   PB4 = backlight enable (LOW=on, active-low GPIO — NOT PWM)
 *
 * GC9107 notes:
 *   - MADCTL=0x98: MY=1, ML=1, BGR=1 — R and B channels swapped in GRAM
 *   - CS must stay LOW for the entire init sequence
 *   - Sleep Out requires 120ms before Display On
